      <span class="paragraph-heading">Background</span> Inspire is a modern-day successor of
      <a href="https://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/about/">Spires</a> - a 1960s database of particle physics literature curated by Standard Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in
      collaboration with physics institutes around the world.
      <span class="highlight">In 1991 it became the first website in North America.</span> In May 2007, CERN, DESY, Fermilab and SLAC decided to
      build the next-generation High Energy Physics (HEP) information system which would combine the successful SPIRES database
      content with
      <a href="http://invenio-software.org/">Invenio</a> digital library technology developed at CERN and thus
      <a href="http://inspirehep.net/">Inspire</a> was born. INSPIRE is run by a collaboration of CERN, DESY, Fermilab, IHEP, and SLAC, and interacts closely
      with HEP publishers, arXiv.org, NASA-ADS, PDG, HEPDATA and other information resources.</p>

    <p>When I joined the Inspire team on 1st of September, 2017, it was working on transitioning Inspire into a new and improved
      web app which provided a ton of new features to its users, including (but not limited to) google style search, author
      disambiguation for high-quality profiles and improved search capabilities and faster results. This new application
      was using Angular 2.0 (and sometimes AngularJS) as a frontend technology framework along with gulp, bootstrap, and
      jinja.</p>

        <br> The frontend architecture and design is now being re-implemented using React and other tools</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Even though the generated app could indeed support several new features, the developers were quite discontent with both,
      the quality of code and team efficiency. Therefore, in February 2018 we adopted the Scrum framework to develop and
      deliver features in iterations and in April 2018 the frontend engineers decided to build a true SPA using
      <span class="highlight">React and Redux for development and state management, Ant design as the design framework, and Jest, Enzyme, and Puppeteer
        for testing.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="paragraph-heading">Team Structure</span> At Inspire, we are a team of a project leader, a project manager (/product owner), a content
      specialist, a systems engineer, 2 front-end engineers (including myself), 4 back-end engineers, 2 full-stack engineers,
      2 data-scientists, and about 5 curators. After adopting the agile software development approach, we split ourselves
      into 2 smaller, self-organizing and cross-functional teams. I am now a part of 'Exclusive Unicorns' team (we like to
      give ourselves cheeky names) which comprises of 2 front-end engineers, 3 back-end engineers, and 1 full-stack engineer.
      Since our team does not have a dedicated UI/UX designer, the project manager and I contribute to the design and user
      testing phases of the product.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="paragraph-heading">My role and responsibilities</span> Everyday physicists from around the world submit their articles to Inspire. In
      addition to that, there are other sources from where papers and reports are harvested automatically on a regular basis.
      A small team of people at Inspire curate these submissions to make sure that the information saved on Inspire databases
      is useful to the HEP community. Thus, the tools and services provided by Inspire can be categorized into the following
      2 groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Back-office tools - These are used by the curators to accept, reject, or modify records and solve exceptions that occur
        during the process of migration of records from the legacy system to the new one.</li>
      <li>Front-office tools - or the 'User facing services' that are meant for physicists and HEP enthusiasts search for and
        cite articles.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">As a front-end engineer, I worked on both these groups of tools.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="paragraph-heading">Contributions to the front-office tools</span>
      Conducted user tests and helped in the design and development of the search results page, the 'detailed record page' for
      HEP literature records, and the author submissions page.

          <span class="paragraph-heading">Exceptions Dashboard</span> I developed, designed, and gathered user requirements for a dashboard that displays
          and helps resolve exceptions that occur during the migration of records from the legacy system to the new version
          of Inspire.
