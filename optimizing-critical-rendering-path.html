    <p>The term 'Critical Rendering Path' (or CRP), is used to describe the series of steps that a browser takes to render the
      initial view of a webpage. This project was built upon the knowledge that my team and I gathered while working on its
      predecessor project
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9YhTcAWmY79ZnJTYklyYWcwSkU/view?usp=sharing">(Analysis of Hyper Text Transfer Protocols and its Variants)</a> in which a detailed study of the HTTP Request/Response
      cycle as well as security and performance advantages of HTTP/2.0 were explored. In this project we specifically focused
      on strategies that can be used to speed up the process of rendering a page on the viewer's browser.</p>

      <span class="paragraph-heading">Purpose</span> Users are accessing the information on the Internet on a wide range of devices through different types
      of connections, whose speed vary from very slow to lightning fast. The request for resources also arrive from several
      different geographical locations. All of this complicates the task of high speed delivery of high quality content over
      the internet. Thus it is imperative for developers and creators of information to follow as well as come up with techniques
      that increase the performance of their websites and ensure timely and effective access to the information that they
      want to present. The major purpose of this project was to study and summarize some of the various techniques and good
      practices that we, as developers can use to build high performance website.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="paragraph-heading">Process</span> In order to optimize the critical resources of a website, we started by
      <span class="highlight">studying the steps involved in critical rendering path and the Timeline events (on the Chrome DevTools).</span> Upon
      focusing on the steps before the render tree construction, we realized that DOM and CSSOM construction are usually
      the steps that are worst offenders and make the pages render very slowly. If we could optimize these steps, we could
      achieve the fast rendering. This
      <span class="highlight">required an understanding of how the critical resources - HTML, CSS and JavaScript are related to each other</span>
      since all the three resources depend on each other and affect the way browser will process them, hence affecting the
      speed of rendering. Details on all of the steps involved in rendering a page and the dependencies between the critical
      resources are mentioned in the
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3EeaX5KDehR3RDvH1ELIN7gROk82blq/view?usp=sharing">project report</a>.</p>

    
    <p>Once we had clear idea of the CRP and the interdependencies between the resources that make a webpage we started focusing
      on optimizing the steps that the browser takes before constructing the render tree, which are â€“ the construction of
      DOM and CSSOM, because these are these are the worst offenders and can make the pages render very slowly. It is important
      to note that in this project, we didn't dwell on using algorithms with least running time, efficient memory management,
      or garbage collection techniques. Also, since the strategy of streaming HTML to the client as fast as possible had
      already been discussed in the previous project they were not covered in this one.</p>

    <p>The steps we used to achieve fast rendering rates of our demo website can be broken down into the following three broad
      categories.
      <ul>
        <li>Minimization, compression and caching of the HTML, CSS, and JS resources</li>
        <li>Minimization of render blocking resources (CSS)</li>
        <li>Minimization of parser blocking resources (JS)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="paragraph-heading">Tools used for measuring and optimizing the CRP</span> As part of the implementation of what we have learnt about the
      steps that the browser goes through to render the page and the key strategies that are applied to improve the performance
      of a site, we made a
      <a href="https://dinika.github.io/optimized-portfolio/">demo website</a> and measured its performance using PageSpeed Insight Tool. We used
      <span class="highlight">Chrome Canary (developer version of Chrome) and Chrome Dev Tools to analyze the website</span>. Timeline panel of Chrome
      Dev Tools gave us a low-level view of what the browser does as it loads a page. We recorded a trace and analyzed all
      the activities of the website. The different events in the Event Log panel describes the steps that the browser goes
      through while rendering a page starting from sending a request, processing the response to painting the pixels onto
      the screen. (The Timeline panel on the previous versions of Chrome Canary has now been replaced by the Performance
      panel in the latest version which provides the combined functionality of Timeline and JavaScript CPU Profiler panel).</p>

    <p>Following the steps outlined above and understanding the CRP metrics, we were able to
      <span class="highlight"> improve PageSpeed scores of the demo website from 28/100 on mobile devices and 30/100 on desktops to 93/100 and 95/100
        respectively</span>
    </p>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 4em"><span class="paragraph-heading">After Optimization</span></p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/img/optimized-mobile.jpg" alt="Score of 93/100 for the unoptimized website on mobile devices">
        <figcaption>Score of 93/100 for the unoptimized website on mobile devices</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/img/optmized-desktop.jpg" alt="Score of 95/100 for the unoptimized website on mobile devices">
        <figcaption>Score of 95/100 for the unoptimized website on mobile devices</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>An important conclusion we arrived at through this project is that we must always measure first and (if need be) optimize second.</p>
