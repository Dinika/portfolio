      I am a software engineer specialized in front-end engineering. I am
      dedicated to writing maintainable, well-tested systems that are easy for
      developers for scale and provide a truly good quality experience to the
      users. Currently, I am building RESTful web services for third party
      consumers, using event-sourcing for state management. I love to work on
      optimizing performances for user facing applications. I value a
      collaborative team environment very highly.
